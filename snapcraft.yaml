summary: OpenBazaar Server Daemon in Go
description: |
  OpenBazaar server daemon handles the heavy lifting for the OpenBazaar desktop
  application. The server combines several technologies: A modified IPFS node,
  which itself combines ideas from Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia. A lightweight SPV
  Bitcoin wallet for interacting with the Bitcoin network. And a JSON API which
  can be used by a user interface to control the node and browse the network.
