// Wallet interface is used by openbazaar-go for both normal wallet operation (sending
// and receiving) as well as for handling multisig escrow payment as part of its order flow.
// The following is a very high level of the order flow and how it relates to the methods
// described by this interface.

// 1) The buyer clicks a button to place an order with a vendor. In addition to populating
// the order with all the relevant information, the buyer's node calls the `GenerateMultisigScript`
// interface method to generate an address and redeem script that is unique for the order.
// The order is then sent over to the vendor for evaluation.
//
// 2) The vendor receives the order, takes his public key as well as the key provided by the
// buyer and moderator and likewise calls `GenerateMultisigScript` and compares the returned
// address and redeem script to those provide by the buyer in the order to make sure the
// buyer provided valid information. He then sends a message to the buyer notifying that he
// has accepted the order.
//
// 3) The buyer can then either send funds into the multisig address using an external wallet
// or if he wishes to use the built-in wallet, he calls the `Spend` interface method and
// provides the multisig address as the destination.
//
// 4) After the buyer receives the goods he clicks the complete order button in the UI to
// leave a review and release the funds to the vendor. His node calls the `CreateMultisigSignature`
// interface method to generate a signature for the transaction releasing the funds. The signature is
// sent over to the vendor along with his review.
//
// 5) The vendor receives the review and the signature then calls `CreateMultisigSignature`
// himself to generate his signature on the transaction. We now have the two signatures necessary
// to release the funds. The vendor then calls the `Multisign` interface method and includes
// both signatures. The multisign function combines all the signatures into one valid transaction
// then broadcasts it to the network.
//
// The above example is only one possible order flow. There are other variants based on whether or
// not the vendor is online or offline and whether or not the buyer is doing a direct payment or
// escrowed payment.

	// did the buyer, the vendor will reject the order.
	//
