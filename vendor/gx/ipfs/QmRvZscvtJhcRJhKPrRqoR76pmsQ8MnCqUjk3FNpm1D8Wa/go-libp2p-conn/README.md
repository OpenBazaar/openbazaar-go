> A library providing 'Connection' objects for libp2p.

This package offers wrappers for `go-libp2p-transport` raw types,
exposing `go-libp2p-interface-conn` types.

It negotiates either plaintext or secio over the raw connection
using `go-multistream`.

## Usage

On the server side, a `go-libp2p-transport` Listener is wrapped in a `go-libp2p-interface-conn` Listener with `WrapTransportListener`. Such `iconn.Listener` has a peer identity: an ID and a secret key. These are only used when connections are encrypted, and a missing secret key forces plaintext connections.

On the client side, a `Dialer` creates `go-libp2p-interface-conn` connections using a set of `go-libp2p-transport` Dialers. Like with Listener, a Dialer has an ID and private key identity to be used to negotiate encrypted connections. Dial also checks the peer identity if encryption is enabled by specifying a secret key in Dialer.

Encryption is forced on when `go-libp2p-interface-conn.EncryptConnections` is true and the Dialer/Listener has a secret key, and forced off otherwise.

## Protocol overview

The protocol is fairly straightforward: upon opening a connection, `go-multistream` is used to agree on plaintext (`"/plaintext/1.0.0"`) or encrypted (`"/secio/1.0.0"`). Plaintext will only be negotiated iff both peers have `go-libp2p-interface-conn.EncryptConnections` set to `false` or haven't constructed their Listeners/Dialers with secret keys.

If plaintext is selected, the connection is used as-is for the rest of its lifetime.

If encrypted is selected, `go-libp2p-secio` is used to negotiate a transparent encrypted tunnel. The negotiation happens before the connection is made available to the library consumer.
