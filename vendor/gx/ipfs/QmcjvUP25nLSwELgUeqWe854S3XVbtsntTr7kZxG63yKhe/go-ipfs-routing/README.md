## Install

`go-ipfs-routing` works like a set of regular Go packages:

```
> go get github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-routing/...
```

This module uses [Gx](https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx) to manage
dependencies. You can use `make all` to build it with the `gx` dependencies.

## Usage

This repo contains 3 different packages.

### Mock

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-routing/mock?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-routing/mock)

```
import "github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-routing/mock"
```

Mock is a fake router useful for tests. It provides a mock client that
implements the `IpfsRouting` interface and a mock server from which the client
retrieves routing records.


### Offline

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-routing/offline?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-routing/offline)

```
import "github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-routing/offline"
```

Offline is an offline router that can put and get records to and from a local
`Datastore` but can't retrieve them from the network.

### None

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-routing/none?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-routing/none)

```
import "github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-routing/none"
```

None is a router no-op router that doesn't do anything. Puts always succeed and
lookups always fail.
