This repository contains the OpenBazaar server daemon which handles the heavy lifting for the [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/) desktop application. The server combines several technologies: A modified [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) node, which itself combines ideas from Git, BitTorrent, and Kademlia. A lightweight SPV Bitcoin wallet for interacting with the Bitcoin network. And a JSON API which can be used by a user interface to control the node and browse the network. If you are looking for the OpenBazaar user interface code see [here](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-desktop).

## Install

A typical install of OpenBazaar contains a bundle of the server daemon and user interface. If this is what you are looking for you can find an installer at https://openbazaar.org/download.html. If you are looking to run the server daemon by itself or to contribute to developement see below for instructions.

### Install Pre-built Packages

The easiest way to run the server is to download a pre-built binary. You can find binaries of our latest release for each operating system [here](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/releases/).

### Build from Source

To build from source you will need to have Go installed and properly configured. Detailed instructions for installing Go and openbazaar-go on each operating system can be found in the [docs package](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/tree/master/docs).

## Dependency Management

We use [Godeps](https://github.com/tools/godep) with vendored third-party packages.

### IPFS Dependency

We are using a [fork](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/go-ipfs) of go-ipfs in the daemon. The primary changes include different protocol strings to segregate the OpenBazaar network from the main IPFS network and an increased TTL on certain types of DHT data. You can find the full diff in the readme of the forked repo. The fork is bundled in the vendor package and will be used automatically when you compile and run the server. Note that you will still see github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs import statements instead of github.com/OpenBazaar/go-ipfs despite the package being a fork. This is done to avoid a major refactor of import statements and make rebasing IPFS much more easy.

## Updating

You can either pull in remote changes as normal or run `go get -u github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go`

## Usage

You can run the server with `go run openbazaard.go start`

### Options
```
Usage:
  openbazaar-go [OPTIONS] start [start-OPTIONS]

The start command starts the OpenBazaar-Server

          --disablewallet         disable the wallet functionality of the node
          --disableexchangerates  disable the exchange rate service to prevent
                                  api queries
          --storage=              set the outgoing message storage option
                                  [self-hosted, dropbox] default=self-hosted
```

## Documentation

When ready we will put up a full documentation of the OpenBazaar protocol and the JSON API at https://docs.openbazaar.org

## TODO

The server is currently under heavy development. Most of the underlying networking is complete and what remains is to build out the order/purchase flow. We expect to have a development release which will be capable of browsing the network in a few weeks.
